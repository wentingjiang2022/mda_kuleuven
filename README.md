# Explain mortality of heatwaves - Europe study

The goal of the project is to investigate why some countries suffer more in heatwave than others. We define the cost of the heatwave here as the total number of deaths from the heatwave. The period of investigation is from 2003 to 2023, because ...

In order to utilize the various indicators from Eurostat, we narrow down the Europe region.

Here are some of the key tools and libraries that were used in this project:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**: Machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib, offering a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- **Plotly Express**: A library for creating interactive visualizations in Python.
- **SHAP**: A Python library for SHapley Additive exPlanations - a unified framework for interpreting machine learning models.
